# ScrapingHub Scrapy Cloud API Client (Jobs and Items APIs)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mgoodnight/scrapinghub-scrapy-cloud-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mgoodnight/scrapinghub-scrapy-cloud-client)

## What is this?
This is a client interface for ScrapingHub's Scrapy Cloud APIs.  I've currently only implemented Items and Jobs.  There are several other [APIs](https://doc.scrapinghub.com/scrapy-cloud.html#scrapycloud) that are under Scrapy Cloud and I will add them as I need them.  However, I welcome contributions!  

## Usage

```
dzil listdeps | cpanm
